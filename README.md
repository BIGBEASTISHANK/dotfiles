# Dotfiles – Arch Linux Configuration

## 🎯 Overview

These dotfiles serve as a complete system configuration setup for Arch Linux users using the **Linux kernel** and **NVIDIA drivers** (not compatible with `linux-lts`). This is more than a rice or aesthetic setup—think of it as a `nix.config` for Arch. It provides a fully configured, ready-to-use workflow and development environment.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This setup is tailored **exclusively for Arch Linux** with the **standard `linux` kernel** and **NVIDIA graphics**. Do **not** use it with `linux-lts`.
